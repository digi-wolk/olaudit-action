# About

Github Action for the [OSS license auditor](https://github.com/digi-wolk/oss-license-auditor) project (`olAudit`).

For documentations please refer to the main repository.

# Usage

Example (uses Github's default token, scoped to the repository that runs it)

```yaml
name: Audit licenses

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ] # Update to your branch name

jobs:
  audit-licenses:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OSS License Auditor
        uses: digi-wolk/olaudit@v1
        with:
          path: .
          comment-on-pr: true
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

In order to avoid facing GitHub API rate limits, we use Github Action's default token which is set 
as `${{ github.token }}`. You can also manually set this default value to either
`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` or `${{ github.token }}`.
This token is automatically generated by GitHub and is scoped to the repository that is currently running the action,
and does not have enough permission to comment on the Pull Request. You can override this token with a personal 
access token (PAT) with a limited scope.
To create a PAT on Github:
- Go to your [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)
- Open Developer settings
- Open Personal access tokens
- Open Fine-grained access
- Click on Generate new token
- Select the necessary permissions
- Click on Generate token

I recommend to use fine-grained access rights limited to one repository and only for commenting on Pull Requests:

After having created the token, you can add it as a secret to your repository:
- Go to your repository
- Open Settings
- Open Secrets
- Click on New repository secret
- Add the token as a secret
- Use the secret name in your workflow file (i.e. `GH_PAT`)

Example with Personal Access Token (PAT):

```yaml
name: Audit licenses

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ] # Update to your branch name

jobs:
  audit-licenses:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OSS License Auditor
        uses: digi-wolk/olaudit@v1
        with:
          path: .
          comment-on-pr: true
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```
